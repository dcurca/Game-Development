# Game-Development
While in university I took a game development course focusing on C# in unity.
I created 2 games with C#, the first of which is a maze game where you needed to collect 3 items to in turn open 3 doors in the maze. 
It also included a timer and a leaderboard 

The second game is a classic platform game, I designed and created all levels by myself. Here we have enemies that can defeat you. 
The game includes moving platforms, a healthbar, and attacks.
